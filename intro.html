Howdy interactive colleagues!

<p>This Adventure Time is going to be the most interactive and adventurous in the history of times!
  We shall form competitive teams of two-three people and
  walk a beautiful route answering questions about the digitally marked waypoints.
  The teams will set out on the journey right from the office door and will navigate with a compass app.



<p>There is a little preparation to be done.
  In each team there shall be one navigator, while the others are the men of wisdom.
  The navigators should install
  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/commander-compass-lite/id340268949?mt=8">Commander Compass Lite</a>
   on an iPhone 5 and  do the following:

  <ul>
  <li> Double tap on the screen in the compass app, and turn the map on.

   <li>Import the waypoints by downloading <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/lpak3t58oo1kyku/waypoints.spyglass">this file</a>
    on the iPhone and choosing to open it with the compass app.


  <li> Tap on the nav arrow in the top right corner of the app, so that the view centers at your current location.
  It should look <a href="commander-compass.png">something like this</a> then.

</ul>


<p>One of each team's wise men should then open <a href="index.html">this page</a> on their iPhone.
  There you will see the list of questions associated with the waypoints.
  When you arrive to a waypoint, you can submit an answer to the question. If the answer is correct,
  some points will be added to your score.
  Note that the more wrong attempts you make the less points you get for a question.
  As soon as you earn enough points, the last locked item in the list will be unlocked.
  There  you will find the final instructions telling you
  how to proceed to the place where we can reunite and replenish the energy lost in the journey.

<p>The full route will probably take you at least 2 hours,
  so you should make sure your iPhones are charged and take some water and snacks with you.
  Leaving the office about 5 pm, we shall all meet at the final destination about 7 pm.


  <p>We wish you good luck and  hope you enjoy it!</p>


<p>P.S. To make sure that everything works for you perfectly interactively,
 it would be great if you could already walk to the first waypoint (P0, very close to the office)
  and try answering its question on Thursday or Friday morning.
